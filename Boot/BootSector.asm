; After detecting the active partition, the master boot record loads the first 512 bytes of the partition into memory at the address
; 0x7C00, therefore all our addresses have to be aligned to this
org   0x7C00

; We have organized our addresses to 0x7C00, this means all addresses are based from 0x7c00:0, because the data segments are within
; the same code segment, they are nulled
xor   ax, ax                      ; Sets the AX register to 0 by performing an exclusive or operation on it
mov   ds, ax                      ; Sets the data segment to 0
mov   es, ax                      ; Sets the extra segment to 0

mov   sp, bp                      ; Sets the top of the stack (since the stack is empty at the beginning, this is the same as the
