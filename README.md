# Axiom

## Introduction
Axiom is a personal experimental project, which explores the inner workings of operating systems as well as the intricacies of the IA-32
architecture and possibly even the AMD64 architecture.

## Open Source
Although being a personal project I decided to host the source code publicly on GitHub, so that other people who are interested in the
subject can benefit from it. One goal of the project is to have a high quality documentation. Currently the source code documentation is
very good in my opinion and details every step that is taken and reasons behind it. I plan to add more documentation to the source code
in the near future, which will contain hardware details and references to further information.

The project is licensed under the MIT license, which pretty much means you can do what ever you want with the source code (although I do
encourage you to read the license text, because there are still some rules you have to abide to). I am very open about feedback or even
pull requests, so if you have ideas to improve on my work, then you are more than welcome to contribute. But still, this is a personal
project, therefore I will decide what is being added to it and what is not.

## Current status
I am more or less actively developing this project in my spare time. This potentially means that from time to time I won't have any time
to spare and will not be able to work on the project. Currently the project is &ndash; *I can not stress this enough* &ndash; in a **very
early** stage. I am still working on a very simple boot loader and haven't even started writing a simple kernel.

## Setup
If you want to try this project out, even though it momentarily does nothing more than render a success message after booting, then feel
free to do so.

First make sure, that you have successfully checked out the Axiom repository. Also you need to have qemu installed for emulating the
operating system. For example under Debian (or Ubuntu) you can do that like so:

```bash
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86
```

Then compile Axiom using its Makefile (unfortunately the Makefile currently needs elevated root rights, because it uses loopback devices,
this will hopefully change in the future):

```bash
sudo make All
```

The Makefile generates a FAT12 formatted floppy disk image in the Build folder. The custom boot sector has been installed on it. Now you
can use qemu to test the "operating system":

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 Build/Axiom-0.0.1-Pre-Alpha-1.img
```

If you have any suggestions, then please feal free to open an issue on GitHub. Alternatively fork the project and send me a pull request.
